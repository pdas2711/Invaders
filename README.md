# Space Invaders

This is a Galactica clone made in the C++ language using the Ncurses library. This is just a small project for some learning experience and, therefore, not a high priority to continue on working. The project has much to be improved on but it is functional. I originally worked on this on my own without using git so it won't show as many commits but I decided to upload this here in case it becomes helpful for someone else. I've built this in a Linux environment so I'm not sure how it will hold up in other operating systems like Windows. If you are on Linux, there is a binary you can test out.

## Compiling

Just run `make` to compile. `make clean` will delete the binary and any *.o* files.

## Controls

- A or Left Arrow to move left
- D or Right Arrow to move right
- W or Space Bar to shoot
- P to pause/resume the game

Health bar is on the left and kill points are on the right.
